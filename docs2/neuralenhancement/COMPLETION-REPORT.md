## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Sequential Agent Spawning**
   - 3 agents spawned sequentially (011, 012, 013)
   - Each agent completed successfully
   - Using `coder` subagent type worked better than `specification`

2. **Forward-Looking Context**
   - Each task explicitly told next task what to retrieve
   - Memory coordination patterns consistent
   - Dependency chain clear

3. **Template Consistency**
   - All 13 tasks follow identical structure
   - Makes specifications predictable
   - Easier for implementers to follow

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Agent Type Selection**
   - First attempt with `specification` agent claimed success but didn't write files
   - Switched to `coder` agent type which successfully wrote files
   - Lesson: Verify agent outputs, don't trust claims

2. **Memory System**
   - No existing PROJECT_ID in memory (from previous session cleanup)
   - Not an issue - tasks generate new PROJECT_ID
   - Documentation handles this scenario

### Process Improvements

1. **Verification After Agent Completion**
   - Always verify file exists after agent claims completion
   - Check file size and content
   - Don't proceed until confirmed

2. **Template Usage**
   - Providing complete template to agents works well
   - Reduces ambiguity
   - Ensures consistency
